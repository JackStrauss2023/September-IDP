During this IDP, I learned how to draw objects on multiple screens. The main purpose for doing this is to have some objects leave a trail on the screen and others that do not. The small circles on the screen remain on the screen. But, as the ship, the star, and the planets move they do not leave a trail. I learned how to organize my code for the star and the ship during this project with a function. I learned how to use conditionals to make sure the star stays on the screen. A revision that I made was changing the method on how the x and y values are generated for the star. Originally, the star moved based on a random width and height, therefore making the star move quickly and having rigid movement. Later in the year, I learned how to use perlin noise for the movement of shapes. I then applied what I learned to the star's movement.
