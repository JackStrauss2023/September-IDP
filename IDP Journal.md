9/26

I followed a tutorial about a new function in p5 javascript, createGraphic. I was able to create a sketch that represents space and the solar system. I have circles that represent small stars drawn on the screen and do not erase on one canvas. My sketch also contains a big star that moves randomly across the screen becasue of its changing x and y values. The star does not leave a trail and does not erase. If the star goes off the canvas it will reappear back on the screen

During this work period, I added to my IDP because I worked on my R2 password generator project on 9/23. I created a spaceship that moves horizontally across the screen similar to the star. These shapes do not leave a trail and do not erase. If these shapes leave the canvas, they will return back on the screen. I also have a sun and three plants that rotate around the sun. This represents the solar system with the plants orbiting the sun.
